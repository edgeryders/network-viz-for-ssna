# The updateVisualization(centerViews = True) function can be called
# during script execution to update the opened views
# The pauseScript() function can be called to pause the script execution.
# To resume the script execution, you will have to click on the
# "Run script " button.
# The runGraphScript(scriptFile, graph) function can be called to launch
# another edited script on a tlp.Graph object.
# The scriptFile parameter defines the script name to call
# (in the form [a-zA-Z0-9_]+.py)
# The main(graph) function must be defined
# to run the script on the current graph
